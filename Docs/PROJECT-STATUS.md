## Test Results

22,289 assertions passing across 6 test suites:

| Suite | Assertions | What it tests |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| test_astro | 11 | JD conversion, day-of-week, solar longitude, ayanamsa, sunrise |
| test_tithi | 18 | Tithi at known dates, kshaya/adhika detection, lunar phase |
| test_masa | 24 | Month name, adhika months, solar rashi, Saka/Vikram years |
| test_validation | 744 | **External validation**: 186 dates verified against drikpanchang.com x 4 checks |
| test_csv_regression | 4,416 | **Regression**: 1,104 sampled days from generated CSV (1900-2050) x 4 checks |
| test_adhika_kshaya | 17,076 | **Regression**: all 4,269 adhika/kshaya tithi edge-case days (1900-2050) x 4 checks |

## Validated Against drikpanchang.com

186 dates spanning 1900-2050 verified against drikpanchang.com day-panchang pages:

- **54 general dates** (1950-2045): hand-picked covering month boundaries, adhika months, year transitions
- **132 adhika/kshaya tithi edge-case dates** (1900-2050): batch-verified in 5 rounds, including 52 adhika tithi dates and 80 kshaya tithi dates
- Tithi at sunrise: 100% match (186/186)
- Month (masa) name: 100% match (186/186)
- Adhika month detection: 100% match (tested 1993, 2004, 2007, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2023, 2039, 2050)
- Saka year: 100% match (186/186)
- Sunrise time: within ~1 minute of drikpanchang.com (Moshier ephemeris vs Swiss files)

## Regression Tests

A 55,152-day CSV (`ref_1900_2050.csv`) was generated by our calculator for 1900-2050. Two regression test suites verify self-consistency against this CSV — they catch unintended changes from code modifications but are **not** independently validated against an external source. The 186 spot-checked dates above give confidence the underlying data is correct.

## Validation Web Page

A browser-based tool for manual month-by-month comparison against drikpanchang.com, covering all 1,812 months from 1900 to 2050.

- **Server**: `bash validation/web/serve.sh` → http://localhost:8081 (no-cache headers)
- **Layout**: Transposed calendar grid (rows = days of week, columns = weeks), matching drikpanchang.com
- **Reingold overlay**: Orange-highlighted cells where Reingold/Dershowitz (Surya Siddhanta, `hindu-lunar-from-fixed`) disagrees with our Drik Siddhanta calculation
  - 5,943 of 55,152 days differ (89.2% match rate)
  - Toggle on/off via "R/D overlay" checkbox in header
- **Data pipeline**: `python3 tools/csv_to_json.py` regenerates all JSON from `ref_1900_2050.csv` + `reingold_1900_2050.csv`

## Known Limitations

- Uses Moshier ephemeris (built-in, ~1 arcminute precision) instead of Swiss Ephemeris data files (~0.001 arcsecond)
- Amanta scheme only (no Purnimanta support)
- No nakshatra, yoga, or karana calculations
- No kshaya masa detection (extremely rare edge case)
- UTC offset is manual (no IANA timezone / DST support)
- Location defaults to New Delhi; no city database

## Source Statistics

- Application code: ~880 lines across 12 files (6 .c + 6 .h)
- Test code: ~600 lines across 6 files
- Vendored Swiss Ephemeris: ~34,600 lines (11 .c + 12 .h)
